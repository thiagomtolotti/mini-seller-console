- Use ES6 syntax and imports.
- Use functional components and React hooks.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Use vitest for writing tests.
- Use React Testing Library for component testing.

- Write tests in the same folder as the component it tests, with a .test.tsx extension.
- If the component is not on a dedicated folder, create a folder with the component name, move the file there, rename the file to index.tsx, and add the test file.
